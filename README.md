## DataLoader: A Flexible, Multi-Format Data Loading Utility

The DataLoader class provides a powerful and flexible way to load datasets of various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, MAT, JSON, HDF5, images) from hierarchical directory structures. Designed for efficiency and scalability, it allows users to specify columns of interest, rename columns, and load images using popular frameworks like OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Key Features:

Recursive Directory Traversal: Automatically traverses nested directories based on user-defined levels.
Multi-Format Support: Handles various data formats, including tabular data, MATLAB files, and images.
Selective Data Extraction: Allows selection and renaming of specific columns for tabular data.
Framework-Specific Image Loading: Supports image loading with OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
This utility is ideal for data scientists, engineers, and researchers who need a robust and versatile tool for loading and preprocessing data in different formats as part of a larger data analysis pipeline.
