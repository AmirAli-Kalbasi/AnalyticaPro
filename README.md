  - Example Structure:
    ```plaintext
    /data_path/
        â”œâ”€â”€ G1/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PreTest/
        â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ R1/
        â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file1.csv
        â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file2.csv
        â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ R2/

        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ R1/
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ R2/
        â”œâ”€â”€ G2/
        .
        .
        .
        â””â”€â”€ G3/
        .
        .
        .
    ```
    This structure can be represented by the list levels = ['groups', 'tests', 'rats'], where:

      - 'groups' corresponds to G1, G2, G3,
      - 'tests' corresponds to PreTest, PostTest, and
      - 'rats' corresponds to the individual records or datasets such as R1, R2.

- Multi-Format Support: Capable of handling a wide range of data formats, the DataLoader is designed to seamlessly integrate with various data types, from traditional tabular data to MATLAB files and complex image datasets.

- Selective Data Extraction: Provides the ability to select specific columns and rename them during the loading process for tabular data, enabling focused analysis and customized data pipelines.

- Framework-Specific Image Loading: Supports loading image data using popular machine learning frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, ensuring compatibility with a variety of image processing and deep learning workflows.

- MATLAB File Handling: Extracts specific variables from .mat files, converting them into pandas DataFrames, which are easy to manipulate and integrate with other data in Python.

- Scalable and Efficient: Designed with scalability in mind, the DataLoader can handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for both small-scale and enterprise-level projects.

- Batch Loading: This feature efficiently loads data in batches, allowing for memory-efficient processing of large datasets. The batch size is customizable, making it ideal for workflow handling data in manageable chunks. 

This utility is ideal for professionals who require a dependable and versatile tool to manage and preprocess data in multiple formats as part of a larger data analysis or machine learning pipeline.
